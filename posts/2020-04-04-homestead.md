title: One Pandemic Day in April
---

Today we had things to do, despite everything, despite work, despite the virus. No one here is infected so far as we know, but we're still sheltering in place so we use what we have and try not to go out too much. Fortunately, we have a lot.

The kids had rocket kits to put together from 4-H and they also spent some time working on their aerospace project books.

Chris first spent time on making the iguana enclosure, which we need to be finished because the iguana is outgrowing his current habitat and getting mad about it. But he doesn't have the right bolts and it's probably not worth going out in the virus-filled shops just for bolts, so we'll wait until we also need something else, something more urgent. Then he went out and started trimming back the infernal cedars we growing all around our property. They are too big, and too useless, to keep growing as they are. They only serve as an admittedly year-round privacy screen, and privacy is nice but not as good as, say, hazelnuts or huckleberries would be. So, he's cutting.

We urgently need to do laundry because it's been cold and snowy for the past week or so, and we like to hang our clothes out. Today is warm and sunny, so it's laundry day.

I found a bison knuckle in the freezer, the freezer we are trying to empty a bit because on Wednesday we're getting 10 chickens from the Hutterite colony and we will need freezer space for them. The scraps bag in the freezer was also full, so the scraps plus the bison knuckle are currently turning into stock.

The iguana needs new fresh "salad" so I go out and find dandelion greens and plantain and chop them up with the last of the bean sprouts. He'll eat well, and tonight I'll start a fresh batch of bean sprouts.

The (small) aquaponics system needs something new planted in it, so we clean out the rocks from the last batch of arugula and plant some fresh radish seeds -- we'll eat these as sprouts.

We're continually trying to get less plastic in our house so we want to replace our bottles of body wash with bar soaps; however, bar soaps are ... not delightful to use. So today I tried felting one with wool roving left over from some needle-felted Christmas ornaments we made a couple of years ago.

There is buttermilk powder from old food storage that needs to be used up, which is fortunate since fresh milk is scarce right now. I've made many loaves of quick bread with it today.

Also started a no-knead bread, a yeasted coffee cake for breakfast tomorrow morning, and a sourdough starter from fruit. <!-- this is the only one not done yet -->

Now I need to go continue teaching my children how to cook by rehashing our lesson about how to make delicious macaroni and cheese. It's sort of late, we should have started it an hour ago.
